rabbit-race
===========

This is a rabbit vs. turtle race that allows the user to create their own racer

I've commented all of the code in the html file.

Mainly the edit I made was to allow the user to create their own racer, and allocate the statistics for their racer by balancing the speed and focus attributes.
